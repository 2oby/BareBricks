WytWallz: 

A revolutionary fully decentralised app that connects artists to empty wall spaces. Adopting a host model along the lines of AirBnB, we transform vacant walls into canvases, giving artists the platform to showcase their talent and host an opportunity to monetise free wall space. Your wall, their masterpiece.
